If you find some issue with this overlay, e.g. some package missing an
ebuild, please open an issue on our GitHub
`bug tracker <https://github.com/rafaelmartins/octave-overlay/issues>`_.

This overlay is updated weekly by a cron-job.

Follow the steps described on layman's post-install message, and after that,
